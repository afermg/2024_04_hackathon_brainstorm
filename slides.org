***  Showcase the tools we have built to approach JUMP data
***  CytoData Hackathon: Resources, Challenges and Limitations
***  Collect feedback and ideas on both tools and plans

* Current JUMP toolkit
** Is it really that hard to access/process JUMP data?

** Is it really that hard to access/process JUMP data?

-  @@b:<1>@@ *Loads of data*
  - ~115k chemical perturbations
  - ~15k genes (KO'd, overexpressed or both).

- @@b:<2>@@ *Scattered metadata*
  - How do we visualise the images from which a profile was produced?
  - Are these two perturbations from the same batch/plate?

- @@b:<3>@@ *Diverse backgrounds*
  - How can biologists with limited coding experience benefit?
  - How can developers build their own tools?

# ** What is the "right" way to analyse morphological profiles?
# - What are previous analyses and their conclusions?
# - How can we evaluate

** Some user stories of biologists
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_ACT: [<+>]
:END:

@@b:<1->@@ I have -omics data for *X* modified gene or chemical compound.
- How do cells affected by *X* look?
- What else produces similar morphologies?
- What are the distinctive features of *X*-perturbed cells?
- Can my *X* be found under a different name?

** We preprocess data and publish it via Datasette
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_ACT: [<+>]
:END:
=jump_rr= (JUMP Round-Robin) is our Python tool to perform pairwise computations on profiles or features using the GPU. It also processes metadata to build whole image paths.

=Datasette= is a Python libary to visualise, query and edit databases; it is deployable via WebAssembly (runs on the browser).

** How do cells affected by *X* look?
=gallery=: Explore all the images with an associated profile.
[[./imgs/gallery.jpg]]
** What else produces similar morphologies?
=simile=: Find the most similar (and dissimilar) perturbations.
[[./imgs/simile.jpg]]
** What are the distinctive features of *X*-perturbed cells?
=feature=: Find the most distinctive features of a perturbation, or amongst all.
[[./imgs/feature.jpg]]
** Does *X* have an alternative identity?
=broad_babel=: Translates IDs (JUMP, Symbol/InChiKey, Entrez id, Broad) and which are controls.
[[./imgs/babel.jpg]]

** The tools can be organised based on question and dataset...

#+RESULTS:

** Ok, that's "fun" and all, but what about developer experience?
pandas! pandas! pandas!
\\
The following tools are available via pip.

** =broad_babel=: Three SQL wrappers in a trenchcoat.
Tool to translate its and provides essential information.
- ID goes in, ID(s) come out
- ID goes in, control metadata comes out

It doubles as a central accessible source of ground truth for identities and metadata.

** =jump_portrait=: Spice-up your workflow with cell images

Fetch a subset of images associated to a perturbation. Optionally, include their respective negative controls.
- Foci-level images are accesible, not single-cell.
- Negative controls is essential to account for +batch effects+.
- Useful to train Deep Learning models on images on-the-fly(?).


** Other nice JUMP-adjacent tools
- jump-dti: Fetch data from drug-target interaction (@John)
- cpg-data: Fetch images for any CellPainting data (@Ank)
- SMILES without borders: Cheminformatics black magic (@Srijit)

** Aren't you just procrastinating the dive into biology?
\pause
#+begin_center
#+latex: {\Huge{Perhaps.}}
#+end_center

** So, we need biology vignettes
# :PROPERTIES:
# :BEAMER_ACT: [<+->]
# :END:
Or at least tutorials/documentation for others to make their own
\pause
\\
#+latex: {\large{¿Por qué no los dos?}}

As a side-note, it would be neat not to suffer an overdose of .ipynb

** JUMP central concentrates knowledge, including (battle-proven) code to keep the evergrowing info in a leash.

* How to organise a hackathon (the fun parts)
** We have a visual!

** WikiHow to the rescue

** What are the goals?

[[./imgs/wikihow_2.jpg]]
** What are the goals?
# :PROPERTIES:
# :BEAMER_ACT: [<+->]
# :END:
- Promote JUMP (and Imaging) as an additional tool in the scientists' data arsenal
- Pair biologists with questions and computer scientists with who can tackle those questions
- Encourage folks to apply their own methods, knowledge and skills to find out new/better approaches to use morphological profiles

** An open-ended hackathon
The data and tools will be available beforehand
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[./imgs/wikihow_4.jpg]]
** Are more winners more fun?
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[./imgs/wikihow_3.jpg]]
** We are set two independent tracks
*** Further a biological story
*** Build a tool that helps data processing

Prizes are more symbolic, we are aiming for colllaborative more than competitive.

** How should we structure teams?
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth
[[./imgs/wikihow_5.jpg]]
** Structuring teams is hard
There are multiple options for forming groups
- Allow some teams to come prepared?
- On-site mixing of computer scientists and biologists
- Both (is it a fair competition to pitch these teams against each other?)
** Sponsors are an option
[[./imgs/wikihow_6.jpg]]
** One sponsor has step up
- $1000 dollars for prize + Ardigen-branded gadgets
- One data analyst and one biologist to help out with organisation
** Limitations
- 40-60 maximum room capacity
- ~6.5 real hours for design/coding/analysis
- Wide range of technical and biological expertise
* Brainstorm session
** Suggestions from your own experiences?
- Things you liked about an event
- Specific considerations for Bio Hackathons (e.g., Allen Institute)
** Current elements in the air
- Do we charge a registration fee?
- Should we give preference to registrants of Cytodata/SBI2?
- We have guaranteed $1k for prizes. We may have up to 8 winners.
- What are attractive prizes that will be palatable to the sponsors and committee?
** Any other suggestions?
