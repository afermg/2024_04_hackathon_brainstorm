***  Showcase the tools we have built for JUMP
***  CytoData Hackathon: Resources, Challenges and Limitations
***  Collect feedback and ideas on both tools and plans

* JUMP (beta) toolkit

  - ~15k genes (KO'd, overexpressed or both).

- @@b:<2>@@ *Scattered metadata*
  - How do we visualise the images from which a profile was produced?
  - Are these two perturbations from the same batch/plate?

- @@b:<3>@@ *Diverse backgrounds*
  - How can biologists with limited coding experience benefit?
  - How can developers build their own tools?

# ** What is the "right" way to analyse morphological profiles?
# - What are previous analyses and their conclusions?
# - How can we evaluate

** Some user stories of biologists

@@b:<1->@@ I have -omics data for *X* modified gene or chemical compound.
- How do cells affected by *X* look?
- What else produces similar morphologies?
- What are the distinctive features of *X*-perturbed cells?
- Can my *X* be found under a different name?

** We preprocess data and publish it via Datasette

:BEAMER_ACT: [<+>]

=jump_rr= (JUMP Round-Robin) is our Python tool to perform pairwise computations on profiles or features using the GPU. It also processes metadata to build whole image paths.

=Datasette= is a Python libary to visualise, query and edit databases; it is deployable via WebAssembly (runs on the browser).

@@b:<1->@@ I have -omics data for *X* modified gene or chemical compound.
- @@b:<1>@@ How do cells affected by *X* look?
  - @@b:<1>@@ =gallery=: Explore all the images with an associated profile.
- @@b:<2>@@ What else produces similar morphologies?
  - @@b:<2>@@ =simile=: Find the most similar (and dissimilar) perturbations.
- @@b:<3>@@ What are the distinctive features of *X*-perturbed cells?
  - @@b:<3>@@ =feature=: Find the most distinct
- @@b:<4>@@ Does *X* have an alternative identity?
  - @@b:<4>@@ =broad_babel=: Translates IDs (JUMP, Symbol/InChiKey, Entrez id, Broad) and which are controls.

** The tools can be organised based on question and dataset...

** Ok, that's fun and all, but what about developer experience?
The following tools are available via pip.

** =broad_babel=: Three SQL wrappers in a trenchcoat.
Simple tool to
- ID goes in, ID(s) come out
- ID goes in, control metadata comes out

It doubles as a unique source of ground truth for identities and metadata.

** =jump_portrait=: Sprinkle cell images to your workflow
Cambridge dictionary: "a painting, photograph, drawing, etc. of a person or, less commonly, of a *group of people.*"

Fetch a subset of images associated to a perturbation. Optionally, include their respective negative controls.
- Foci-level images are accesible, not single-cell.
- Negative controls is essential to account for +batch effects+.
- Useful to train Deep Learning models on images on-the-fly(?).

** Other nice JUMP-adjacent tools
- JUMP-DTI: Fetch data from drug-target interaction (@John)
- CPG: Fetch data from drug-target interaction (@Ank)

# :END:
- Pair biologists and computer scientists to try to find solutions and follow-up questions
- Encourage folks to apply their own methods, knowledge and skills
- Facilitate software developers to build a tool that makes JUMP more accessible
** An open-ended hackathon
- The data and tools will be available beforehand
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[./imgs/wikihow_4.png]]
** More winners is better
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[./imgs/wikihow_3.png]]
** We set two independent tracks
*** Further a biological story
*** Build a tool that helps data processing
** Structuring teams is hard
[[./imgs/wikihow_5.png]]
** Structuring teams is hard
There are multiple options for forming groups
- Allow people to form teams beforehand
- Make teams that combine computer scientists and biologists
- Both (is it a fair competition to pitch these teams against each other?)
** Sponsors
[[./imgs/wikihow_6.png]]
** Ardigen offered becoming a sponsor
- $1000 dollars for prize + Ardigen-branded gadgets
- One data analyst and one biologist to help out with organisation
** Limitations
- 40-60 maximum capacity
- ~6.5 real hours for design/coding/analysis
- Wide range of technical and biological expertise
* Brainstorm session
** Suggestions from your own hackathons?
** Pain points
- Do we charge a registration fee?
- Should we give preference to registrants of Cytodata/SBI2?
- We have guaranteed $1k for prizes. We may have up to 8 winners.
** Any other suggestions?
